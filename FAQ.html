              </div>
              <p class="answer">Gems are the engagement metric used on the Peer Network platform. You can earn Gems through various user actions, including:
                <br>1. Liking a post: +5 Gems.
                <br>2. Disliking a post: -4 Gems (this action also costs Peer Tokens).
                <br>3. Commenting on a post: +3 Gems.
                <br>4. Viewing a post: +0.25 Gems.
                <br>These Gems are then converted daily into Peer Tokens based on the total amount of Gems earned across the platform. This system incentivizes active content creation and interaction among users.</p>

              </div>
              <p class="answer">Daily interactions on Peer Network are governed by specific limits and associated token fees. Users are encouraged to engage with the platform while respecting these limits. 
                For example, you can make one free post per day, but additional posts will incur a cost in Peer Tokens.
              <br>Additionally, users must adhere to daily limits on token usage for actions such as liking and disliking content, which also have associated token penalties. 
              The platform guidelines are designed to promote healthy engagement and prevent abusive use of features.</p>

                Specifically, you can earn the following Gems for different actions:
                <br>1. Liking a post: +5 Gems.
                <br>2. Commenting on a post: +3 Gems.

              <p class="answer">Yes, if someone dislikes your content, you will lose 4 Gems. Additionally, the user who dislikes your post will incur a cost in Peer Tokens.

              <p class="answer">If you want to withdraw your Peer Tokens, you must initiate a transfer to the Peer Liquidity Pool. The process involves the following steps:
                <br>1. You send your Peer Tokens to the liquidity pool.
                <br>2. The platform calculates the token value using a constant product formula.
                <br>3. The equivalent value in Bitcoin (BTC) is sent to the platform's internal wallet.
                <br>4. The BTC is then converted into fiat currency and transferred to your linked bank account.
                <br>Please note that you must have completed KYC verification and linked a bank account to be eligible for this cash-out process.</p>

              </div>
              <p class="answer">To exchange your Peer Tokens for Euro, you need to follow these steps: 
                <br>1. Initiate a Transfer : Start by sending your Peer Tokens to the Peer Liquidity Pool.
                <br>2. Token Valuation : The platform will calculate the value of your Peer Tokens using a constant product formula based on the liquidity pool's BTC reserves.
                <br>3. BTC Conversion : Once the token value is determined, the equivalent amount in Bitcoin (BTC) will be sent to the Peer Network's internal wallet.
                <br>4. Fiat Conversion : The BTC will then be converted into Euro (or your desired fiat currency) by the Peer Network.
                <br>5. Transfer to Bank Account : Finally, the converted Euro will be transferred to your linked bank account.
                <br>Please ensure that you have completed KYC verification and linked a bank account to be eligible for this cash-out process.</p>

                <h3 class="question">Why does the token price change?</h3>

              </div>              
              <p class="answer">The Peer Token price changes due to its pairing with BTC in a liquidity pool. The token value is determined through this liquidity pool, which is owned and operated by the issuer. 
                Additionally, token burning mechanisms and transaction fees contribute to long-term value stabilization.</p>

                <h3 class="question">1. What happens if a creator's content goes viral and earns an extraordinarily high number of Gems in a single day? Is there a cap on how many tokens one person can earn?</h3>
                <img class="arrow" src="img/toggle.webp" alt="Toggle">
              </div>
              <p class="answer">There is no cap on how many Gems a user can earn. However, the number of Peer Tokens distributed daily is fixed at 5,000 (declining 10% annually). 
                Token distribution is based on proportional contribution. So, if a user earns significantly more Gems, their share of the daily token pool increases accordingly. The system remains proportional, not capped per user​.</p>

            <div>
              <div class="Q">
                <h3 class="question">2. What measures are in place to prevent bot networks that could artificially generate engagement and farm tokens?</h3>
                <img class="arrow" src="img/toggle.webp" alt="Toggle">
              </div>              
              <p class="answer">To combat manipulation:
                <br>1. Peer Network uses KYC verification, reducing the risk of bots and fake accounts.               
                <br>2. Engagement actions have costs (e.g., 5 Tokens per dislike), discouraging spam.
                <br>3. Dislike abuse and mass-posting are discouraged through token penalties and post limits (one post/day for free, additional posts cost tokens)​.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div class="Q">
                <h3 class="question">3. If token value decreases significantly due to many creators cashing out simultaneously, what safeguards exist to protect new users who've just earned tokens?</h3>
                <img class="arrow" src="img/toggle.webp" alt="Toggle">
              </div>              
              <p class="answer">The liquidity pool works on a Constant Product Formula, so large withdrawals lower token value temporarily. However, Peer Network balances this by:
                <br>1. Burning tokens when users pay for ads or features.
                <br>2. Allowing advertisers to buy and burn tokens, increasing scarcity.
                <br>3. Maintaining a 10% annual token reduction, creating long-term deflationary pressure.
                <br>This design offers supply-side balancing to stabilize value over time​.</p>

                <h3 class="question">4. How will Peer Network balance content moderation with decentralization principles? Who ultimately decides what content violates guidelines?</h3>

              </div>              
              <p class="answer">Peer Network enforces:
                <br>1. Strict community guidelines, especially in Telegram and social channels.
                <br>2. Plans to include moderators and build safe spaces free from misinformation and market manipulation. <br>
                <br>Content moderation appears to be centralized with human oversight, though decentralized tooling might evolve over time​.</p>

                <h3 class="question">5. What happens to the platform's token economy if growth stagnates and new users/advertisers stop joining?</h3>
                <img class="arrow" src="img/toggle.webp" alt="Toggle">
              </div>              
              <p class="answer">In such a scenario:
                <br>1. Token values may decline due to reduced demand.
                <br>2. The platform’s BTC reserves and liquidity pool would buffer short-term exits.
                <br>3. The company’s financial strategy includes diversified asset allocation and contingency loans, ensuring continued operations during downturns. <br>
                <br>Our focus on sustainable revenue (e.g., marketplace fees) helps decouple growth from token speculation​.</p>

              <div class="Q">
                <h3 class="question">6. Does the 10% annual reduction in token distribution unfairly advantage early adopters at the expense of users who join years later?</h3>
                <img class="arrow" src="img/toggle.webp" alt="Toggle">
              </div>              
              <p class="answer">Yes, early users do receive more tokens per unit of engagement due to higher daily token emissions. However:
                <br>1. The system remains proportional—later users still earn based on relative activity.
                <br>2. Token scarcity over time may increase long-term token value, offering latecomers potential upside. <br>
                <br>This creates an incentive to join early, but not an exclusionary advantage​.</p>

                <h3 class="question">7. How will Peer Network prevent the formation of "engagement cartels" where groups of users coordinate to boost each other's content artificially?</h3>
                <img class="arrow" src="img/toggle.webp" alt="Toggle">
              </div>              
              <p class="answer">To safeguards such incidents Peer include following checks:
                <br>1. KYC checks, making fake account networks difficult.
                <br>2. Cost structures for engagement (dislikes, multiple posts, etc.).
                <br>3. Plans for detailed performance dashboards—this transparency could expose suspicious activity patterns. <br>
                <br>Further anti-collusion mechanics may be developed as the platform scales​.</p>

                <h3 class="question">8. If a user accumulates a large number of tokens but Peer Network shuts down or pivots its business model, what guarantees do users have regarding the value of their tokens?</h3>
                <img class="arrow" src="img/toggle.webp" alt="Toggle">
              </div>              
              <p class="answer">There are no explicit guarantees about token value retention in the event of a shutdown or pivot. However:
                <br>1. PeerTokens are paired with BTC in a liquidity pool, offering exit liquidity as long as the platform operates.
                <br>2. Tokens must be burned for services, reducing speculative risk but limiting portability. <br>
                <br>This design encourages utility over speculation, but users are exposed to platform risk like any app-specific token system​.</p>
